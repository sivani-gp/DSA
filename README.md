# DSA
Welcome to my personal DSA journey!  
This repository is where I’m actively learning and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. I started this to improve my coding skills, deepen my understanding of algorithms, and prepare for competitive exams and interviews in engineering.

## Why I Started This Repo

- To build a strong foundation in problem-solving for technical interviews
- To reinforce concepts from daily practice and study plans
- To keep track of what I’ve learned and improve over time
- To create a resource for myself and other students tackling DSA
